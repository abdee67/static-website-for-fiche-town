<P class="DL">Debre Libanos (Amharic: ደብረ ሊባኖስ, Oromo: Dabra libanose) is an Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo monastery, lying northwest of Addis Ababa in the North Shewa Zone of the Oromia Region. It was founded in 1284 by Saint Tekle Haymanot as Debre Atsbo and was renamed as Debre Libanos in the 15th century. He meditated in a cave above the current monastery for 29 years. The monastery's chief abbot, called the Ichege, was the second most powerful official in the Ethiopian Church after the Abuna.

    The monastery complex sits on a terrace between a cliff and the gorge of one of the tributaries of the Abbay River (the Blue Nile). None of the original buildings of Debre Libanos survive, although David Buxton suspected "there are interesting things still to be found among the neighbouring cliffs".[1] Current buildings include the church over Tekle Haymanot's tomb, which Emperor Haile Selassie ordered constructed in 1961; a slightly older Church of the Cross, where Buxton was told a fragment of the True Cross is preserved; and five religious schools. The cave where the saint lived is in the nearby cliffs, which one travel guide describes as a five-minute walk away.[2] This cave contains a spring, whose water is considered holy and is the object of pilgrimages.
    
    According to Buxton, the original route to Debre Libanos was through a cleft in the cliffs that line the eastern side of the Abbay.[3] In the late 20th century a road was laid from the main Addis Ababa – Debre Markos highway to the monastery; it is a little more than 4 kilometres (2.5 miles) long. </P>
